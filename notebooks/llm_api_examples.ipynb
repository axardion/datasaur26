      "   - **Chest imaging** (portable CXR or bedside lung ultrasound) to assess for infiltrates or complications (e.g., pneumonia, pulmonary embolism).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Baseline labs** (to gauge severity)\n",
      "   - CBC with differential, CMP, CRP, D‑dimer, ferritin, LDH.\n",
      "   - Pulse oximetry (target SpO₂ ≥ 94 % on room air; consider supplemental O₂ if <94 %).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Risk stratification**\n",
      "   - Age ≥ 65 y, obesity (BMI ≥ 30), diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, immunosuppression → higher risk for progression → consider early antiviral therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Therapeutic considerations (if COVID‑19 confirmed)**\n",
      "   - **Outpatient** (if mild, stable SpO₂, no high‑risk features):  \n",
      "     - Antiviral (e.g., Nirmatrelvir‑Ritonavir = Paxlovid) started within 5 days of symptom onset.  \n",
      "     - Monoclonal antibodies if circulating variants remain susceptible.\n",
      "   - **Hospital admission** (if SpO₂ < 94 %, worsening dyspnea, or high‑risk comorbidities):  \n",
      "     - Supplemental oxygen, consider dexamethasone, remdesivir, and anticoagulation per local guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Supportive care**\n",
      "   - Hydration, antipyretics (acetaminophen), rest.\n",
      "   - Educate on isolation (minimum 5 days from symptom onset and ≥24 h fever‑free without antipyretics) and monitor for red‑flag symptoms (confusion, persistent chest pain, cyanosis, worsening dyspnea).\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",

      "### Documentation tip for coding\n",
      "\n",
      "- **U07.1** is used *only* when SARS‑CoV‑2 infection is **lab‑confirmed** (PCR, NAAT, or antigen test).  \n",
      "- If testing is pending or negative but clinical suspicion remains high, you may initially code **J12.9** (viral pneumonia, unspecified) and later update to **U07.1** once results return.  \n",
